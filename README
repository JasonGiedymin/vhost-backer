    License Notes: If you find yourself using using, modifying, selling
                   this script please give proper dedication to your users
                   that this script was created and maintained by me.  It's
                   only right, and provides me and others motivation,
                   contributes to the general stability and life of this
                   project, and serves as a basepoint.

      Description: vhost-backer is a lightweight vhost and wordpress backup
                   script. This script is best used for storing long term
                   snapshots of large webserver site implementations.
                   Think datawarehouse, when dealing with these backups.
                   The script has the ability to read WordPress config files
                   and will back those databases up along with the core
                   files.  This script is lagging behind our own deployment
                   at amuxbit, and it is the hope that in time the FOSS
                   version will be up to date.  Some goals for making this
                   project FOSS was to enhance stability _and_ readability.
                   No doubt, there are many different implementations to
                   backing up data and wordpress, this is just one.
                   Enjoy.

        EC2 Notes: If your running on EC2 you may have issues with a live and
                   heavy trafficked site. Future updates will be better
                   suited for EC2 duty. Stay tuned!

             ToDo: backup backout,
                   expanded function documentation,
                   EC2 compatability,
                   simple user mode,
                   encryption keys
                   switchable modes,
                   interactive mode,
                   accept command line switches

 This script works under the following recommended vhost structure (sample):
 / (root)
 |-var
    |-www
       |-vhosts
           |-htdocs (things like your WordPress install, etc...
           |-admin (a special admin site perhaps)
           |-logs (holds your logs)
           |-keys (where your might store your SSL keys)
           |-backup (a place to store your backup files)
               |-htdocs.tar.bz2 (a backup file)
               |-admin.tar.bz2 (a backup file)
               |-scripts.tar.bz2 (a backup file)
           |-scripts (maybe you have special scripts JUST for this vhost)
